Here I draw some conclusions.

\section{Future Work}
Testing or generating Bayesian Network idioms from simulations. The dream is to get ``plug and play'' Bayesian Network idioms - preconnected structures (perhaps even with some probabilities attached) that you can add evidence to and adapt and combine if necessary. Using simulations, we can test the granularity of these possible idioms, to simulate an crime at larger and smaller resolution (more or fewer events) to see how well the idioms can capture it.
