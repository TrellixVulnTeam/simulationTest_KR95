Reasoning with evidence in law is cool!




\textbf{The main research question for this Master's Thesis is: can we automatically create good Bayesian Networks that reflect the ground truth of simulations? If so, can we use this simulation + Bayesian Network setup to investigate BN idioms and methods for law more generally, to see how well the probabilistic approach holds up?}
